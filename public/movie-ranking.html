<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
<p>Really engaging dystopian show on Netflix.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit</h3>
<p>Love J.R.R. Tolkien as an author. The movies are a very good adaptation to his series.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I was introduced to Star Wars by my mom. I really like listening to the Star Wars canon on Youtube.</p>
